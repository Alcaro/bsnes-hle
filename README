bsnes-mercury
-------------

bsnes-mercury is a fork of higan, aiming to restore some useful features that have been removed.
The main one is getting the interface sane, which is accomplished through libretro; however, HLE emulation of some special chips has also been restored, to improve performance.

The name is because metals are shiny, like the accuracy promises of bsnes, and mercury is the fastest metal. It's also poisonous :)
